# huc_website

This is will be the latest version of the website that is up and running at http://hyperloopuc.com The site is hosted on github and the repo is private.

NO COMMITS SHOULD BE PUSHED TO MASTER UNDER ANY SCENARIO.

Please push all your commits to the new /dev branch while changing the code. The /master branch will automatically update the website. So be extra cautious. Once the dev is up to date and every person on the repo agrees that the code is good enough to go live, merge the dev branch to the master branch.

For any specific questions call me @ 6149177850 or email palmerha@mail.uc.edu

For all new users to the repo, start from index.html
