# huc_website

This is will be the latest version of the website that is up and running at http://hyperloopuc.com
The server is AWS. 

NO COMMITS SHOULD BE PUSHED TO MASTER UNDER ANY SCENARIO.

Please push all your commits to the new /dev branch while changing the code. The /master branch has a webhook that will automatically update the website on AWS. So be extra cautious.
Once the dev is up to date and every person on the repo agrees that the code is good enough to go live, merge the dev branch to the master branch. 


For any specific questions call me @ 5136418673 or email dhaval.shiyani@hyperloopuc.com

For all new users to the repo, start from index.html
